# Parallelism-RFI
Note - we may need to create a new repo since I'm using VS2015. 

call test_merge_string_serial() to test merge sort using name and a date value (# of days between date given and current date). To get a date value call get_date_value(month, day, year). 

call create_random_nums(size) with size being # of random numbers to be generated. I can only get to a 100 million before it breaks. 

calling test_merge_int_serial() creates 100 mil random ints and then sorts them
